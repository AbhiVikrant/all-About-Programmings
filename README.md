GitHub offers its basic services free of charge. Its more advanced professional and enterprise services are commercial.[[6\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub#cite_note-6) Free GitHub accounts are commonly used to host [open-source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source) projects.[[7\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub#cite_note-7) As of January 2019, GitHub offers unlimited private [repositories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repository_(version_control)) to all plans, including free accounts, but allowed only up to three collaborators per repository for free.[[8\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub#cite_note-8) Starting from April 15, 2020, the free plan allows unlimited collaborators, but restricts private repositories to 2,000 actions minutes per month.[[9\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub#cite_note-techcrunch-2020-04-14-9) As of January 2020, GitHub reports having over 40 million users[[10\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub#cite_note-10) and more than 190 million [repositories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repository_(version_control))[[11\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub#cite_note-11) (including at least 28 million public repositories),[[12\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub#cite_note-12) making it the largest host of [source code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_code) in the world!
